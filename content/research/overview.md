I was trained as a [statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician) in my Ph.D. study, but my research interests span high-dimensional statistics, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, control theory, and scientific machine learning. My ultimate research goal is to develop a new generation of **<span style='color: red;'>stochastic numerical methods</span>** that exhibit promising **<span style='color: red;'>statistical and computational efficiency</span>** for solving knotty problems in statistics and engineering.

I develop practical methods by leveraging classical optimization techniques (e.g., exact penalty, augmented Lagrangian, trust region, active set, and interior-point methods) and reforming these techniques to address pressing modern challenges, such as **<span style='color: red;'>scalability</span>**, **<span style='color: red;'>reliability</span>**, and **<span style='color: red;'>adaptivity</span>**.

Toward the ultimate goal, my current research mainly includes the following topics:

* <font size="3"> Constrained stochastic optimization </font> 
* <font size="3"> Statistical inference of stochastic second-order methods </font> 
* <font size="3"> ML problems with physics-informed constraints </font>
* <font size="3"> Stochastic real-time optimal control \& model predictive control </font> 
* <font size="3"> Semiparametric graphical models </font>
