I was trained as a [statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician) in my Ph.D. study, but my research interests span theoretical statistics, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, control theory, and scientific machine learning. My ultimate research goal is to develop a new generation of **<span style='color: red;'>stochastic numerical methods</span>**

with promising statistical and computational efficiency for solving knotty statistical and engineering problems.
