The above figure is from [Na et al., 2020](/publication/pubs/na-2020-estimating), which shows the glass brains for the estimated differential network between the schizophrenia and control groups based on an fMRI dataset. 


Semiparametric models allow for flexible modeling of data without making rigid assumptions the parametric models make, while at the same time allowing for tractable estimation without suffering from the curse of dimensionality that obsesses fully nonparametric models. Check out my works on semiparametric index models ([Na and Kolar, 2021](/publication/pubs/na-2021-high), [Na et al., 2019](na-2019-high)) and semiparametric matrix completion problems ([Na et al., 2020](/publication/pubs/na-2020-semiparametric)).

In addition, I work on graphical models that are used to model complex relationships between observed variables and have numerous applications in genetics, neuroscience, and computational biology. See [Na et al., 2020](/publication/pubs/na-2020-estimating) for my work on the estimation of differential networks under the presence of latent factors.
