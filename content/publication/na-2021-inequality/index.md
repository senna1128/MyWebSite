abstract: "We study nonlinear optimization problems with stochastic objective and deterministic equality and
inequality constraints, which emerge in numerous applications including finance, manufacturing,
power systems and, recently, deep neural networks. We propose an active-set stochastic sequential
quadratic programming algorithm, using a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian as the merit
function. The algorithm adaptively selects the penalty parameters of augmented Lagrangian and
performs stochastic line search to decide the stepsize. The global convergence is established: for any
initialization, the “liminf” of the KKT residuals converges to zero almost surely. Our algorithm and
analysis further develop the prior work Na et al. (2021) by allowing nonlinear inequality constraints.
We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a subset of nonlinear problems collected in
the CUTEst test set."
