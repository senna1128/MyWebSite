abstract: 'Abstract Graphs representing complex systems often share a partial underlying
  structure across domains while retaining individual features. Thus, identifying
  common structures can shed light on the underlying signal, for instance, when applied
  to scientific discovery or clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, growing evidence shows
  that the shared structure across domains boosts the estimation power of graphs,
  particularly for high-dimensional data. However, building a joint estimator to extract
  the common structure may be more complicated than it seems, most often due to data
  heterogeneity across sources. This manuscript surveys recent work on statistical
  inference of joint Gaussian graphical models, identifying model structures that
  fit various data generation processes. This article is categorized under: Data:
