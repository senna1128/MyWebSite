abstract: Training a classifier under non-convex constraints has gotten increasing
  attention in the machine learning community thanks to its wide range of applications
  such as algorithmic fairness and class-imbalanced classification. However, several
  recent works addressing non-convex constraints have only focused on simple models
  such as logistic regression or support vector machines. Neural networks, one of
  the most popular models for classification nowadays, are precluded and lack theoretical
  guarantees. In this work, we show that overparameterized neural networks could achieve
  a near-optimal and near-feasible solution of non-convex constrained optimization
  problems via the project stochastic gradient descent. Our key ingredient is the
  no-regret analysis of online learning for neural networks in the overparameterization
  regime, which may be of independent interest in online learning applications.
