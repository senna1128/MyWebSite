We design a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm for solving equality-constrained optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds.
<!-- The proposed algorithm utilizes a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian as the merit function. Theoretically, our algorithm is the first algorithm on constrained manifold optimization that achieves both global and local superlinear convergence, and overcomes the Maratos effect at the same time. Another notable contribution of our work is that we place no strigent assumptions on the retraction $R_x$. -->  
We investigate the performance of the algorithm on minimum balanced cut and fixed-rank matrix completion problems. **(Full details will be revealed soon.)**
